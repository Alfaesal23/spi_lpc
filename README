SPI_LPC Kernel Module
=====================

This out-of-tree kernel modules exports the configuration attributes for the
system SPI chip. The medium-term aim is to get this module included in Linus'
tree so it can be included in distro kernels and so the new sysfs attributes
are avilable to fwupd when SecureBoot is turned on.

This kernel module currently exports three files:

    /sys/kernel/security/spi/bioswe
    /sys/kernel/security/spi/ble
    /sys/kernel/security/spi/smm_bwp

These are used by fwupd to help calculate the Host Security ID. More attributes
will be added over time.

Building
--------

Ensure you have kernel headers installed (e.g. `dnf install kernel-headers`)
and then simply:

    $ make
    make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=$PWD
    make[1]: Entering directory '/usr/src/kernels/5.6.7'
      CC [M]  /home/hughsie/Code/spi_lpc/spi_lpc.o
      MODPOST 1 modules
      CC [M]  /home/hughsie/Code/spi_lpc/spi_lpc.mod.o
      LD [M]  /home/hughsie/Code/spi_lpc/spi_lpc.ko

Then you can insert the module into the running kernel (assuming SecureBoot is
turned off) using:

    sudo insmod spi_lpc.ko

You can then print the various LPC registers using:

    sudo cat /sys/kernel/security/spi/bioswe
    sudo cat /sys/kernel/security/spi/ble
    sudo cat /sys/kernel/security/spi/smm_bwp

To remove the module use:

    rmmod spi_lpc
